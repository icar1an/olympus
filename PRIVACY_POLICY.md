# Privacy Policy for Prometheus

**Last Updated: January 12, 2026**

## Overview

Prometheus ("the Extension") is a Chrome browser extension that analyzes fashion aesthetics from images. This privacy policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your information.

## Data Collection

### Data We Collect

1. **Images for Analysis**
   - When you analyze an image, we temporarily process it through our AI service (Google Gemini)
   - Images are transmitted securely and are not permanently stored on our servers
   - Analysis results are stored locally in your browser

2. **Account Information**
   - If you sign in with Google, we receive your email address, name, and profile picture
   - This information is used for authentication, preventing spam, and personalization

3. **Pinterest Data** (Optional)
   - If you connect Pinterest, we access your boards and pins with read-only permissions
   - We do not modify your Pinterest account in any way
   - Pinterest access tokens are stored locally in your browser

4. **Local Storage**
   - Saved analyses and preferences are stored in Chrome's local storage
   - This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to external servers

### Data We Do NOT Collect

- Browsing history
- Personal files from your computer
- Information from websites you visit (other than images you explicitly choose to analyze)
- Payment information

## How We Use Your Data

- **Image Analysis**: Process images through AI to identify fashion aesthetics
- **Personalization**: Save your analysis history and preferences
- **Pinterest Integration**: Allow batch analysis of Pinterest pins

## Pinterest Connection

Prometheus allows you to connect your Pinterest account to analyze your boards and pins.
- **Secure Connection**: We use standard OAuth 2.0 to securely connect to your Pinterest account.
- **Read-Only Access**: We only request read-only permissions to your boards and pins. We cannot and will not modify, create, or delete any content on your Pinterest account.
- **Token Management**: Pinterest access tokens are stored locally on your device and used only to fetch your board data.
- **Revocation**: You can disconnect your Pinterest account at any time via the extension settings or through your Pinterest account's "Connected Apps" settings.
